Release history for multipass

next
  [LICENSING]
  - The project has been relicensed under the MIT license (more
    precisely called "Expat License", but everyone calls it "MIT
    license" these days).

v17.04  2017-04-08
  [Changed]
  - multipass's window now spawns at the mouse pointer's location (if
    your window manager respects this request).

v17.03.11  2017-03-11
  [Fixed]
  - Compatibility with reparenting window managers has been improved.
    multipass has been tested with katriawm, Openbox, i3 and
    Compiz (Unity on Ubuntu 16.04).
  - Flickering has been reduced.

  [Changed]
  - It is no longer possible to end selection mode by left-clicking in
    multipass's window. You must issue a right-click anywhere on the
    screen.
  - Window IDs are now shown as hex since virtually all other tools do
    this as well.

v17.03  2017-03-05
