Broadcast X11 key events to multiple windows.

This is a generic X11 solution. It works with all X11 clients that
accept synthetic events sent by XSendEvent.


Installation
------------

The following C libraries are required:

    - libx11
    - libxft

multipass expects to be run on a POSIX-ish operating system.

To build the program, run:

    $ make

For customization, edit config.h.


Running
-------

Launch it:

    $ multipass

It starts in "selection mode", so your mouse cursor will turn into a
crosshair. Click on some other windows to include them in the selection.
To end selection mode, do a right-click anywhere on the screen. Key
events received by multipass itself will now be broadcasted to all
selected windows.

To re-enter selection mode later on, click in multipass's window.

If you want to send key events to an XTerm, you need to activate XTerm's
"Allow SendEvents" feature.

I discovered xduplic-copier soon after I wrote multipass. It's *very*
similar, but I couldn't get it to work on my machine. Still, I really
like its mouse-selection mode, so I adopted that. Thanks!
