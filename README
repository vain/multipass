Broadcast X11 key events to multiple windows.

This is a generic X11 solution. It works with all X11 clients that
accept synthetic events sent by XSendEvent.


Installation
------------

The following C libraries are required:

    - libx11
    - libxft

multipass expects to be run on a POSIX-ish operating system.

To build the program, run:

    $ make

For customization, edit config.h.


Running
-------

Just call it:

    $ multipass

You then move your mouse over a window that you want to select and hit
the configured hotkey ("PAUSE" by default). That client will be added to
the list of selected windows. Key events received by multipass itself
will be broadcasted to all selected windows.
